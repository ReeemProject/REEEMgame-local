# REEEMgame
The purpose of this game is to learn about energy systems. Participants will learn how different decisions affect the energy systems and the outcomes for other stakeholders.
This game has been created as part of the REEEM project. The REEEM project is a EU funded project which aims to gain a better understanding of how energy strategies can help the transition to a low-carbon EU energy society (http://www.reeem.org/).
## How to play
The game is a simulation of how the future will look depending on how participants decide to act. In the default scenario there are three roles: east, west and observer. The participant who creates the game is the one who is controlling the game. The creator can invite more participants to the game and has the option to change participant's roles. Furthermore the creator is in control of the time. The game is intended as a multiplayer game where one participant or team acts as east and another participant or team acts as west. As the name indicates the observer role is intended for participants who only observe the game. East and west can make decisions that influence the outcome of the game and participants have access to different indicators which can be used to gain insights into current statistics. The aim of the game is for participants to maximise their overall combined score, which is calculated as the average of three components: social score, economic score and environmental score.
